Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in moving to Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nMinneapolis is known as one of the most comfortable cities in the US. It is praised for its parks and theaters; it also reportedly has rather low crime rates. Most importantly, the Minneapolis-St.Paul metropolitan area is home to some 24 Fortune 1000 companies, and it is one of the country\u2019s top economies. Some people even like to compare this city to New York. \n\nIn our case, a family of three is considering moving to Minneapolis since one of the parents was offered an interesting job opportunity there. They have never been to the state of Minnesota (and Minneapolis in particular), so they decided to consult a specialist on which neighborhood they should pick."
